Daily life in their homeland is defined by veneration of their gods, particularly Thoth and his wife Maâ€™at; the former is credited with the creation of opium, a drug valued by the catfolk for use in religious rituals.",
            "They are cunning, agile, and humble, frequently found as acrobats, monks, and freelancers throughout the Empire. Their ritual use of opium gives them a bad reputation outside their homeland for being burglars, fences, and assassins."
